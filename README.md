# Project Name: Trend Analysis from User Discussions

## Overview:
### Description:
This project aims to develop a system that identifies and analyzes trending topics from user discussions in forums and chats. By implementing topic modeling techniques, the system will help organizations understand popular themes and subjects, assisting in content strategy and community management.

## Objectives:
### Main Goal:
Build an algorithm that can automatically detect and summarize trending topics from large volumes of text data.

### Secondary Goals:
- Provide insights into how topics trend over time and across different discussion platforms.

## Minimum Requirements:
### Core Functionality 1:
Implement a model using topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and categorize main topics from text data.

### Core Functionality 2:
Develop a basic dashboard or interface where users can view trending topics and their related metrics (e.g., frequency, growth).

## Optional Requirements:
### Enhanced Feature 1:
Utilize advanced NLP techniques to improve the accuracy and granularity of topic detection.

### Enhanced Feature 2:
Implement real-time analysis capabilities to track trends as they develop.

### Enhanced Feature 3:
Enable cross-platform trend analysis to compare topics across various forums and chat platforms.

## Data Needs:
### Required Data:
Participants need to collect their own text data from discussions, which could include posts from online forums, chat logs, or social media platforms. They should focus on collecting a diverse set of discussions to cover a wide range of topics.

## Tools & Techniques:
### Required Tools:
- Python.

### Recommended Libraries and Techniques:
- NLP libraries for text preprocessing.
- Topic modeling libraries like gensim for implementing LDA.

## Submission Requirements:
### Code:
A link to the source code with comprehensive comments detailing the purpose and functionality of each section.

### Documentation:
A detailed documentation in the readme that outlines the design, core algorithms, implementation details, and instructions for using the system to analyze trends.
